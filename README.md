# World Happiness Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand which factors most strongly influence happiness scores globally. Using Python, the analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of trends and relationships
- Statistical insights on predictors of happiness

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes:
-Ladder score (happiness score)
-GDP per capita
-Social support
-Healthy life expectancy
-Freedom to make life choices
-Generosity
-Perceptions of corruption
-Source: World Happiness Report

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – project environment

---
## Visualizations
The project contains several visualizations to highlight key insights:
- Happiness Score Distribution
- GDP per Capita vs Happiness Score
- Social Support vs Happiness Score
- Healthy Life Expectancy vs Happiness Score
- Freedom to Make Life Choices vs Happiness Score
- Generosity & Corruption vs Happiness Score

## Key Findings
- Economic Wealth Matters: Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher happiness scores. Economic prosperity is a strong predictor of well-being.
- Social Support & Health: Strong social networks and higher healthy life expectancy are strongly correlated with higher happiness.
- Freedom to Choose: Perceived freedom to make life choices is positively associated with happiness scores.
- Generosity & Governance: Higher generosity and lower corruption perception slightly improve happiness, although their impact is smaller than GDP, support, and health.
- Top vs. Bottom Countries: High-ranking countries on the happiness ladder are typically high-income nations with strong social and health infrastructure, while low-ranking countries often face challenges in these areas.
- Combined Factors: A mix of economic, social, health, and governance factors explains most of the variance in national happiness scores.

## Implications
- Economic growth alone is insufficient; social, health, and institutional factors play critical roles.
- Policymakers can improve national happiness by investing in social support systems, public health, freedom, and governance.
- Further analysis could explore longitudinal trends or additional factors like inequality, employment, and education.


## Technologies Used
- Python – primary language for data analysis
- Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning
- NumPy – numerical calculations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – project execution and documentation

## Future Work
- Include multiple years of World Happiness Reports to analyze trends over time.
- Apply machine learning models to predict happiness scores based on socio-economic indicators.
- Perform regional analysis to identify local factors influencing happiness.
- Explore additional variables such as education, employment, and inequality metrics.
- Deploy an interactive dashboard to visualize happiness factors globally.
